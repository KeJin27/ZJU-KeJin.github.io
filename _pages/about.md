Welcome! My name is Jin Ke, and I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at Southeast University. I will study for a PhD under the guidance of Dr. Qi Ye in the PerPLe Laboratory of the School of Control, Zhejiang University from 2024 to 2029.

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, particularly in semantic segmentation, correspondence learning and NeRF.
